# Lab-Activity-2-State-Management

## How to use this code : 
### First, 
``` cmd
git clone 
```


## Different between Scoped and Ephemeral : 
- Scoped is very useful for application high complexity because, u can manage the state global better than Ephemeral can't manage the state.
- if Ephemeral need to send parameter or callback, Scoped don't need it because Scoped can access state global.
- Ephemeral is not recommended to use if we want to manage lots of data, but Scoped is better because can manage global data.
